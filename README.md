1.	Project Summary:  
Magic ball is a game developed to entertain the user. It consists of ball and plate to hit the ball;  
player has to break all the bricks in game to won game otherwise game is over will be displayed.    
2.	Project Details:  
It Consists of three classes used GUI and abstract classes, 2D graphics and polymorphism.  
To create this project, I used NetBeans software.  
The challenges faced by me was to create the brick board in 2d and hit the ball with bricks and most challenging issue was to break the bricks.  
I am trying to extend it by making board and background better by using advanced GUI so that user can enjoy the games the main changing will be
the way the bricks are set in the game by changing the positions of bricks will make this game more favorable of users. The timer class make my
project unique using it you can set the hard levels of the game otherwise it will bore the users.  
It achieves the attention of users if they find it comfortable to relax and enjoy.  
3.	Conclusion  
At the end I would say this game is best when you want to relax and can further be advanced by adding advanced GUI concepts.
